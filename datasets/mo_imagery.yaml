Name:  Missouri 2023/2024 Statewide Imagery Collection
Description:  The Missouri Spatial Data Information Service is responsible for the storage and distribution of digital spatial data and aerial photography related to the state of Missouri. The 2023/2024 statewide aerial photography was collected at 6" resolution. The northern half of the state was collected during leaf-off conditions of 2023 and the southern half of the state was collected during leaf-off conditions of 2024.

UpdateFrequency:  Missouri used ARPA funds to complete the 6″ resolution project for the whole state. The cost of this is roughly 3 times the cost of a 12″ product (closer to $3M than $1M). File sizes and storage requirements increase 4-fold between 12″ and 6″ resolutions. Without additional funding to make up the difference, the state is likely to return to a 12″ product for the next state-wide project. Our imagery cycle is based on the needs of the funding partners, but tends to refresh every 5-6 years.
